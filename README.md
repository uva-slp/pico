[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/uva-slp/pico.svg?token=aW6wnLAt24FpZ7h9WE5x&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/uva-slp/pico)

The Programming and Instructional Contest Organizer (PICO) is a open source programming contest submission system, written in Django.  It was the result of a year-long project in [UVA's 4th year computer science capstone](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/), and is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).

One can see how PICO works by building the docker container for the project (the ability to pull the container is coming shortly).  See the [PICO docker readme](docker/readme.md) for details.
