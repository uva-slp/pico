The system will be deployed on Professor Floryan's machine. 
It will be on UVA's course server at http://libra.cs.virginia.edu/pico.
There're won't be any specific account needed for running the system; an admin account will be created and passed to the customer. Other than the admin account, all other users have the same accessibility to the system as our system does not have multiple user levels.
