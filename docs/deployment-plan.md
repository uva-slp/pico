The system will be deployed on Floryan's machine. 
It'll be likely on UVA's course server, but we don't know the exact url yet.
There're won't be any specific account needed for running the system. An admin account will be created and passed to customer. Other than the admin account, all other users have the same accessibility to the system as our system does not have multiple user level.
